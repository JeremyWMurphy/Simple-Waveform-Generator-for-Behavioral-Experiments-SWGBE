# Simple Waveform Generator for Behavioral Experiments (SWGBE)
## Currently in use with a [Teensy 4.0](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html) (or 4.1) and an [Adafruit MCP4728 Quad DAC](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4470)
It uses [IntervalTimer](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_timing_IntervalTimer.html) library to run at 5 kHz, which is just fine for the Moore Lab's tactile detection experiments.
